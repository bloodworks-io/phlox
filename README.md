## Usage Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

Phlox is an experimental project intended for educational and personal use. **It is not a certified medical device and should NOT be used for clinical decision-making without thorough validation, regulatory approvals, and under the direct supervision of qualified medical professionals.**

**Key limitations:**

*   **Experimental Code:**  The codebase is a work in progress and may contain bugs and inconsistencies.
*   **AI Hallucinations:** LLM outputs, especially from smaller models, can be unreliable, inaccurate, and may present plausible but incorrect information. **Always verify AI-generated content against trusted sources and use your professional clinical judgment.**
*   **No User Authentication:**  Naively exposing this application to the open internet is highly discouraged. Phlox has no user access controls and, for now, next to no input sanitisation.
*   **Not HIPAA/GDPR Compliant:**  Phlox, in the form provided in this repo, lacks the necessary security and compliance measures for handling protected health information in regulated environments.

**Use at your own risk and only for non-clinical, educational purposes unless you have implemented robust security measures and undertaken thorough validation.**
